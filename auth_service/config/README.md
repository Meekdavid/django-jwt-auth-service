# Configuration

This directory is reserved for additional configuration files that don't belong in the main application settings.

## Purpose

This directory can be used for:

- **External service configurations** (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Environment-specific configs** (development, staging, production)
- **Third-party tool configurations** (monitoring, logging, etc.)
- **Custom application configurations** (feature flags, constants, etc.)

## Current Status

This directory is currently empty but available for future configuration needs.

## Usage Examples

Future configuration files might include:

```
config/
├── redis.conf          # Redis configuration
├── logging.yaml        # Logging configuration
├── monitoring.json     # Application monitoring settings
├── features.json       # Feature flags
└── constants.py        # Application constants
```

## Integration

Configuration files in this directory should be:
- Referenced in Django settings when needed
- Documented with clear usage instructions
- Environment-specific when applicable
- Version controlled (excluding sensitive data)
